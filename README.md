<img src='./assets/autoswappr.png' alt="autoswappr logo" width="250" height="auto"><br>
AutoSwappr is a StarkNet-based decentralized application designed for automated token swapping, offering a one-stop solution to guard against highly volatile non-stable crypto assets. By leveraging the AVNU Exchange, it simplifies the process of auto-swapping non-stable tokens to stable ones through an upgradeable, ownable contract. AutoSwappr streamlines asset management, ensuring secure and seamless token swap processes with minimal manual intervention.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Automated Token Swapping: Subscription-based system for automated conversion of assets
- Multi-Route Support: Flexible routing options for complex token swaps
- Real-time Event Tracking: Comprehensive event logging for swaps and subscriptions

### Technical Features

- Upgradeable Architecture: OpenZeppelin-based upgradeable contract system
- Secure Fee Management: Configurable fee collection system
- Custom Route Configuration: Support for complex multi-token swap routes


## Architecture
AutoSwappr is built on StarkNet and implements:

    - OpenZeppelin standards for upgradeability
    - AVNU Exchange integration for swap execution
    - Event-driven architecture for transaction tracking
